# Kotlinsql

A relational database implemented in Kotlin for educational purposes.

This project is inspired by [gosql](https://github.com/eatonphil/gosql), created by [Phil Eaton](https://github.com/eatonphil). Unlike gosql, which aims to reimplement early versions of PostgreSQL, this project simplifies the design to demonstrate how relational databases can be built.
